All the patients provided their informed consent for the study, which was cleared by the Institutional Ethical committee. 1 ?g of DNA from each patient was used to prepare the libraries using TrueSeq Sample preparation kit (Illumina, Inc). Genomic DNA was captured by hybridisation using Custom selected oligos enrichment kit from Illumina. Captured library DNA 10 picomoles was denatured and subjected to cluster generation using a CBot instrument (Illumina, Inc) on a Paired end Flow cell v3.0. The raw cluster density was ~500,000 mm2 .Sequencing was performed on a Illumina HiScan SQ system using SBS 3.0 reagent. Genes evaluated by Custom selected oligo enrichment kit were BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, PALB2, BRIP1, Tp53, ATR, ATM, BARD1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, NBN, PMS1, PMS2, RAD50, RAD51, RAD51C, RAD52, FANCD2, SMC1A, CDH1, MRE11, MUTYH, PTEN STK11.MDC1,TP53BP1, and CHFR All the suspected mutations were validated by PCR amplification and sanger sequencing.\"",
